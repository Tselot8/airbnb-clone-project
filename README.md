# airbnb-clone-project
**Airbnb Clone - Backend-Focused Learning Project**

## Overview
This is a real-world learning project replicating a booking platform. It emphasizes backend development fundamentals with a strong focus on **system design, relational databases, secure APIs, and CI/CD**. The project simulates real engineering workflows and architecture.

 ➡️ Project Goals
- ✅ **Team Collaboration:** GitHub-based workflow  
- ✅ **Backend Architecture:** Modular service design  
- ✅ **Relational Database Design:** Entities & relationships for bookings, listings, users  
- ✅ **Secure API Development:** Authentication, authorization, and validation  
- ✅ **CI/CD Proficiency:** Automated testing, builds, and deployment  
- ✅ **Documentation & Planning:** Communicate decisions, constraints, and trade-offs  
- ✅ **Ecosystem Integration:** Explore Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in one stack  

 ➡️ Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python)  
- **API Layer:** GraphQL  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Containerization:** Docker / Docker Compose  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
- **Auth & Security:** Django Auth  
- **Dev Tools:** Git and GitHub  

## Technology Stack
This project makes use of a modern backend-focused technology stack that aims for scalability, security, and collaborative development. Each technology plays a specific role in the system:
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building and structuring the backend services. It provides built-in support and services, authentication, and rapid API development.
- **GraphQL**: Serves as the API layer, enabling efficient data queries and mutations. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.
- **MySQL**: A relational database system used for managing structured data such as users, bookings, listings, and payments. It enforces relationships, constraints, and transactional consistency.
- **Docker / Docker Compose**: Containerization tools that ensure consistent environments across development and production. They simplify dependency management, scalability, and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub. It automates workflows such as testing, building, and deploying the application, ensuring reliability and reducing manual errors.
- **Django Auth**: Handles authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring secure access control for users and safeguarding application data.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools that allow team members to contribute, review, and manage code effectively. GitHub also supports issue tracking and documentation.
