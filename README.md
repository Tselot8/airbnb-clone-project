**Airbnb Clone - Backend-Focused Learning Project**

## 🚀 Overview 
The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend system designed to replicate the core functionality of a booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on building a robust backend to manage user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments using technologies like Django, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in backend systems, database design, API development, and application security to create a scalable and efficient platform.

## 👥 Team Roles
- ➡️ **Backend Developer**: Implements API endpoints, designs database schemas, and handles business logic to support features like user authentication and property management.
- ➡️ **Database Administrator**: Designs and optimizes the PostgreSQL database, including indexing and caching, to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
- ➡️ **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment, scaling, and CI/CD pipelines using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions to streamline development and ensure reliability. 
- ➡️ **QA Engineer**: Tests backend functionalities to ensure they meet quality standards and work seamlessly across user management, bookings, and payments.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- ✅ **Django**: A Python web framework used to build secure and scalable RESTful APIs for the application.
- ✅ **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations. 
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing data related to users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. 
- ✅ **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient querying of data for seamless frontend-backend integration.
- ✅ **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks like sending notifications or processing payments.
- ✅ **Redis**: Supports caching and session management to improve performance. 
- ✅ **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions.

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Users  
- **Fields:** `id`, `email`, `name`, `password_hash`, `role`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - A user can create multiple properties and bookings  
  - A user can post multiple reviews on different properties  
### Properties  
- **Fields:** `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Belongs to a user (owner)  
  - Has multiple bookings and reviews  
### Bookings  
- **Fields:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Belongs to a user (booker) and a property  
  - Linked to a single payment record  
### Reviews  
- **Fields:** `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Belongs to a user (reviewer) and a property  
  - A property can have multiple reviews from different users  
### Payments  
- **Fields:** `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Belongs to a booking  
  - Each booking is associated with one payment

## 🌟 Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**: Enables registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures secure access and personalized user experiences.
- **Property Management**: Allows hosts to create, update, and retrieve property listings. This is central to the platform’s functionality.
- **Booking System**: Facilitates reserving properties with check-in and check-out details. It streamlines the reservation process for users.
- **Payment Processing**: Manages secure payment transactions for bookings. It ensures financial reliability and trust.
- **Review System**: Lets users post ratings and comments for properties. It builds trust and aids decision-making.
- **Data Optimization**: Uses indexing and caching to enhance data retrieval and storage efficiency. This improves overall performance.

## 🛡️ API Security
- ➡️ **Authentication**: Uses JWT or OAuth to verify user identities, protecting accounts from unauthorized access.
- ➡️ **Authorization**: Restricts access to resources based on user roles, safeguarding sensitive data like profiles and bookings.
- ➡️ **Rate Limiting**: Limits API requests to prevent abuse and maintain system performance.
- ➡️ **Why Security Matters**: Securing user data preserves privacy and trust, while protecting payments prevents fraud, ensuring a reliable platform.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
- CI/CD pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying code to ensure reliable and efficient releases. For the Airbnb Clone Project, they help catch errors early, maintain code quality, and streamline deployment. Tools like GitHub Actions and Docker are used to run automated tests and ensure consistent environments across development and production.

## 📜 API Documentation
- **REST API**: Documented using the OpenAPI standard, covering endpoints for users (/users/, /users/{user_id}/), properties (/properties/, /properties/{property_id}/), bookings (/bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/), payments (/payments/), and reviews (/reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/).
- **GraphQL API**: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data efficiently.
